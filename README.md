The client is the device that receives information from the server
The web browser is software that display webpages, renders the code that comes from the server
The server is where all the code that makes the webpage is stored, there is the hardware server and software server, an example of software server is APACHE

The browser request a webpage to the server and the server serves the webpage files with the code, then the engine of the browser reads and renders the webpage

Every machine has an IP Address for comunicate with other computers, if the internet is a mailing system then the IP is the address of the computer that indicates where to send or receive the data

ISP (Internet Service Provider) are companies that provide you access to internet, they gave you an IP Address and access to DNS Servers so you can connect to webpages without having to know his IP, to the outside world all the data that comes and goes to your house has only one IP, but if you have multiple devices in your house the ISP will assign a 2nd internal IP to the devices and when the data came out outside the house the data will have another IP

HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used to communicate between client and server
HTTPS (HTTP Secure) its the encrypted version of the protocol

with the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) you can transfer the files of your webpage to the server so you can serve it to other peoplearound the world 

The domain name is the address of your webpage (www.google.com for example), this domain is converted by the DNS protocol into an IP Address

The Top Level Domain is the end of the domain (.com for commercial, .net for network, .us for united states, and so on)
You can use whatever TLD you want, the only ones that are hardly regulated are .edu (educational institutions), .mil (US Military) and .gov (goverments)

DNS (Domain Name System) its the protocol used to translate IP Addresses into Domains Name and viceversa, its a hierirchichal and distributed database

Network: a network is a group of computers connected to each other
Internet: group of networks connected to each other

The internet connects all this networks and computers using a set of standarized protocols and routers (the routers routes the packets and tells them at what IP Address have to go)

Packets: When sending data through internet the file is divided into small units called packets, later the receiver of this packets unites them and reconstructs the original file

Router: Device that tells the packets where to go

Domain Name: The human readable Address of a server (www.google.com for example)

DNS: Domain Name System, converts Domain names into IP Addresses and viceversa

HTTP: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, protocol used to transfer data between the server and the client

HTTPS: Encrypted version of HTTP, uses SSl/TLS protocol to encrypt the data

SSL/TLS: Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security, provide secure comunications to the internet

IP is responsible for routing
TCP or UDP both are responsibles for checking that the packets arrive in a reliable and eficcient way, UDP is the updated version of TCP
